what is an OS?
interface between the user and the hardware - we need something to help convert our requests to binaries (language that computers speak) - which is the operating system

examples of os
windows 
mac os 
linux 
    under linux we have diff operating systems such as:
    - redhat
    - ubuntu 
    - suse
    - debian 
    - etc
- linux is the widely used operating system for servers 

To connect to ec2 vm -- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29933918/ssh-key-permissions-0644-for-id-rsa-pub-are-too-open-on-mac
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/Key_file

sudo su - (to get to root user - user with administrative rights)
ls / - (lists directories)

Linux file system hierarchy 
/ -------- top level directory for all directories (often called root directory)
/root ---- (is the root users home directory)
pwd ----- where am i right now? (present working directory) - root is the administrative user 
/home ----- it is home directory for other users, provides working environment for all users bar the root user
/usr ------ this is by default where softwares are installed
/bin -------- contains commands used by all users (binary file)
/sbin ------- contains commands used only by super user (aka root user)
/var --------contains variable data 


Linux basic commands
date --- show the current date and time
cal ---  show this month's calendar
uptime ---- show current uptime
whoami ----- who you are logged in as
finger ----- display information about user
users / id ---- shows user information
man command ---- shows manual of command
username ---- shows your user name
who / w ----- display who is online

Linux view files commands
ls ----- directory listings
cat filename ----- view file content
less ----- view file content page by page 
more ------ view file content page by page
head ----- view first 10 lines of file content
tail ----- view last 10 lines of file content
page --- view file content page by page

Create and delete file/directory 
ls -l (flag for long list, - is for files and d is for directory)
ll -- shorthand for above command
ls -l -t (flat for timestamp)
ls -l -t -r (just reverses whatever you were going to display)
ls -ltr (this is also valid -- useful for when trying to find out which files got recently updated)
cat > filename ---- (CAREFUL IT CAN OVERWRITE) to create a file and have write capabilities (control + c to exit)
cat >> filename --- adds content to existing file
In linux we have a couple of editors to create files 
touch fileName -- create a filename
nano - create a filename 
vim - vi fileName 
rm - remove a file
mkdir - create a directory 
rmdir - remove a directory that is not empty
rm -rf --- remove a directory 
rm -f (flag stands for force)
tree --- tells you your directory structure 
rmdir ---- only removed EMPTY directories
rm -rf * ---- be careful there is no recycling bin exists in linux 

Managing Files and Directories 
c -- copy a file -- cp file1(source file) file2 --- cant copy directories need to use -r
mv -- move a file + rename file and get copied content (popular question in interviews)
find --- find a file 
grep --- search for a pattern in a file 
cd --- switch between directories 
cd .. -- to get to parent directory 
cd / --- regardless of where i am i wanna go to x file or directory - so cd /root/dir1 or cd ../tmp/dir1
diff --- find content diff in 2 files 
sed --- search and replace paticular pattern
chmod --- change file permissions 
chown --- change file ownership 
file -- show what kind of file it is
